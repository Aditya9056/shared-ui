# Contributing

## Install Required Packages

1. Install node. It's recommended to install `nvm` to switch between node versions.
2. Go to project root folder. Run `npm install` to install all required packages for the project.

## Initialize Local Showcase

1. Execute `npm run watch:assets` to build and start watching SCSS and JS files changes.
2. Execute `npm run watch:showcase` to initialize Jekyll locally.
3. Open <http://127.0.0.1:4000/shared-ui/> on your browser to visualize the showcase.

**Did you experience any problem executing showcase?**
Run `gem install bundler jekyll` to install missing [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) bundler, but also make sure you meet all [requirements](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/#requirements).

## Workflow.

**Note:** Do not commit directly on `master`, `development` or `gh-pages` branches.

1. Run `git checkout -b branch-name development` to create a new branch from `development` branch. You must give it a descriptive name, for example:
	* `new/modal-box` for new features.
	* `improve/modal-box` for improvements.
	* `fix/modal-box` for bugfixing.
2. Commit and push your changes to your new branch: `git push -u development branch-name`.
3. Update `CHANGELOG.md` file with the correct description of your changes. Include DEV NOTES where applicable.
3. Once you're done with a task, file a Pull Request for your branch against `development` branch.
4. Assign @iamleigh or @a-danae to review your code. **Note:** `CHANGELOG.md` must be updated in order for your changes to be approved.
5. Once the Pull Request has been approved, it will be merged in `development` branch.
6. You can delete your branch locally and make sure it does not longer exist remote.

It's a good idea to create the Pull Request as soon as possible so everybody knows what's going on with the project.

## Scoping Styles & Scripts

In order to avoid conflicts with other versions of this library, we are using a versioned body class in the format `.sui-x-y-z`. This class is automatically generated by the `body-class` mixin which should wrap all scss in the project.

Any base styles should also include the `.sui-wrap` class. This class is used in place of the `.wrap` class for plugin admin pages to prevent any Shared UI specific styles from bleeding into the wp-admin menubar and sidebar.
